About:
An implementation of boolean circuits in C. Please see "Circuits.png" and "Extra.png" for the corresponding circuits implemented.

functions corresponding to circuits in the images:

"Circuits.png":
- 1st circuit/circuit (a) --> circuit_a()
- 2nd circuit/circuit (b) --> circuit_b()
- 3rd circuit/circuit (c) --> circuit_c()

"Extra.png"
- circuit_f() and circuit_g()

How to run the code:
1. compile all C files using "gcc -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror *.c"
2. run the executable by typing "./a.out" in the command line
